PUBLI 2: [GOAL: June 1]
- new/load
 => bg.src as url or base64 (when saved)

IDEAS:

    -- TOP --
- HOME level: load level, demos, new level in a level
- make save and load works

    -- OTHERS --
- redo (history)
- dynamic world scale

- red lines for "danger" (kill it with fire!)
- tutorial level

- editor buttons: help, options, new level, load level

- free camera

- jetpack

- snap points for lines (!)

- animations
- sounds / music
- hud

- tp points / level set

- top-down levels

- coins
- goals
- ennemies

- level sharing website

- react ui ?

BUGS:
- ramp accel
- pig spawn
- stable URL (rawgit 301 preloadjs)


FEEDBACK:
- no goals
- hard to add lines (needs panning) => unzoom/zoom
- too static: dynamic items, ennemies,... => pigs ?
- animations
- player invisible on dark


PIXLINGS (similar game):
- step down and one-way platforms
- jetpack like
- paint-like wall drawing
feedback: mario-like scrolling, online marketplace, dynamic items, 3D pictures

MODALS FORMS :
- Save previous settings for cancel.
